# DisQover

This package provides an efficient way of simulating Quantum Random Walks (QRWs) recursively using a fast and versatile classical algorithm. In addition, variations of basic QRWs (i.e., 2D QRW, harmonic QRW, QRW with qutrit, QRW with memory) are also included in the package and can be nicely visualized. Last but not least, users can fit any given probability distribution with the QRW optimization toolkit in this package, which offers a potential interpretation of the underlying dynamical process leading to the observed distribution.   

## Installation


```bash
pip install .
```

## Theory & Examples

See the demo notebook `notebooks/DisQover_demo.ipynb`.
